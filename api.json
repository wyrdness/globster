      "full": "Globsters are large, fibrous, blob-like masses of organic material that occasionally wash up on beaches around the world. Typically white or pale in color, lacking clear anatomical features, and often weighing several tons, these masses have historically sparked speculation about unknown sea creatures. However, modern scientific analysis using DNA testing, histology, and chemical analysis has consistently shown that globsters are decomposed remains of whales, primarily consisting of collagen fibers from blubber. The fibrous texture and blob-like appearance result from the decomposition process, which breaks down most tissues while preserving the dense collagen matrix."
